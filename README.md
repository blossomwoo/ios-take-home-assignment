# The Assignment - a stock tracker

You will write a simple stock tracking app with two screens
1. Screen 1: List of stocks pulled from Polygon.io API
2. Screen 2: Detailed view of a selected stock with a price graph 

## Prerequisites

## Poplygon.io API key

### Important: Poplygon's API has 5 req/min rate. Be sure to copy JSON locally for development. 

To accomplish this task you will need an API key from Poligon.io website. Don't worry this only takes few minutes.

1. Go to https://polygon.io/dashboard/login and register with your favorite method
2. Once registered you can obtain the key here https://polygon.io/dashboard/api-keys

## Screen 1 - list of tickers

Upon launch the app should call https://polygon.io/docs/get_v3_reference_tickers_anchor 

and display a list of tickers with

1. ticker name. I.e. AAPL
2. ticker last price and ticker price change in the last 24 hours

Notice that the HTTP point above does not return ticker price and price change. 
To obtain this information you will need to call https://polygon.io/docs/get_v2_aggs_ticker__stocksTicker__range__multiplier___timespan___from___to__anchor

## Screen 2: ticker details

When user taps on a ticker from the list of tickers they should be redirected to the ticker details screen

On that screen user should see
1. Ticker price change graph (last 24 hours)
2. Ticker name, I.e. AAPL
3. Ticker description
4. Ticker price, I.e. $200
5. Ticker percentage day change, i.e. 3%

To pull data for the price change graph use https://polygon.io/docs/get_v2_aggs_ticker__stocksTicker__range__multiplier___timespan___from___to__anchor
